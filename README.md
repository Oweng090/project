# GUI Dice roller

1. **Purpose:** Have a dice roller you can run in a gui form instead of viewing numbers or text in a console.
2. **Use:** A little Dice game to roll dice for fun or if youlose your dice to a board game.
3. **Tools:** tkinter, pyhton, and Image form PIL ( for when I add the dice result images) 
4. The rock paper scissors is what im basing my basic tkinter useage on.

# Additional Goals

1. I want to add the option to change the color theme based on given choices
2. I want to add the choice of how many set of dice you want to roll at one time (up to six at a time.)
