# GUI Dice roller

1. **Purpose:** Have a dice roller you can run in a gui form instead of viewing numbers or text in a console.
2. **Use:** A little Dice game to roll dice for fun or if youlose your dice to a board game.
3. **Tools:** tkinter, pyhton, and Image form PIL ( for when I add the dice result images)
